## üåé Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive, cleaned, and analysis-ready dataset of **U.S. federal oil and natural gas production and disposition volumes** spanning **January 2015 through September 2025**.

The data originates from the **Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR)** and is compiled from official **OGOR-B reporting forms** under the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI).  
It reflects verified production data across **federal and Native American lands**, serving as a key resource for understanding national energy output and market behavior.

Beyond raw production volumes, the dataset includes detailed **disposition categories** describing how resources are sold, measured, transferred, or used ‚Äî enabling deeper insights for **energy policy**, **market forecasting**, and **sustainability research**.
